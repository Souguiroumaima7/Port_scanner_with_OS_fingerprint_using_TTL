# Port Scanner with OS Fingerprint Using TTL

This tool is a network scanner that performs port scanning and attempts to identify the operating system (OS) of a target machine using the Time To Live (TTL) value in the IP header. It can help with network analysis and vulnerability assessments by detecting open ports and providing insights into the OS running on the target system.

## Features
- **Port Scanning**: Scans a range of ports (TCP/UDP) on a given IP address or range.
- **OS Fingerprinting Using TTL**: Attempts to identify the operating system by analyzing the TTL value of the response.
- **Customizable**: Users can configure the range of ports, scan timeout, and TTL thresholds.
- **Output**: Displays a summary of open ports along with OS fingerprinting results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x or higher
- `scapy` library for packet crafting and sending/receiving
- `socket` library for handling network connections

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install scapy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the script:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/port_scanner_with_os_fingerprint_using_ttl.git
    cd port_scanner_with_os_fingerprint_using_ttl
    ```

2. Run the port scanner by executing the script:

    ```bash
    python port_scanner_with_os_fingerprint.py <target_ip> <start_port> <end_port>
    ```

   **Arguments**:
   - `<target_ip>`: The IP address of the target machine to scan.
   - `<start_port>`: The starting port number for the scan.
   - `<end_port>`: The ending port number for the scan.

3. The script will scan the ports in the provided range and attempt to identify the OS based on TTL values.

### Example:

```bash
python port_scanner_with_os_fingerprint.py 192.168.1.1 80 100
```

This will scan ports 80 through 100 on `192.168.1.1` and attempt to fingerprint the OS.

## OS Fingerprint Methodology

The TTL (Time to Live) value in the IP header is often used by various operating systems in a way that can help us identify the OS. Each OS tends to decrement the TTL by a specific value before sending a response back. By analyzing these values, we can correlate them with known TTL values for various operating systems and make an educated guess about the OS running on the target system.

### Known OS TTL Patterns (Example):
- Windows: 128 TTL
- Linux: 64 TTL
- Cisco devices: 255 TTL

## Output

The output will display the following information:

- **Target IP**: The IP address of the target system.
- **Open Ports**: A list of open ports and their respective services.
- **OS Fingerprint**: The detected operating system based on TTL values (if identifiable).

Example output:

```
Scanning target 192.168.1.1...
Open Ports:
  80 - HTTP
  443 - HTTPS

OS Fingerprint:
  Linux (TTL: 64)
```
